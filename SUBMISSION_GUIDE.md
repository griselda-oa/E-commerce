**Section 3: Functionality Alignment**

**Part 1: Session Management & Admin Privileges** âœ…
- Function: `is_logged_in()` checks if user has valid session
- File: `settings/core.php` (lines 16-18)
- Function: `is_admin()` checks if user has role = 1
- File: `settings/core.php` (lines 24-26)
- Demonstration: Show login works, admin sees different menu options

**Part 2: Category Management** âœ…
- CREATE: `admin/category.php` - Add New Category form
- File: `actions/add_category_action.php`
- RETRIEVE: Shows all categories created by logged-in user
- UPDATE: `actions/update_category_action.php`
- DELETE: `actions/delete_category_action.php`
- Controller: `controllers/category_controller.php`
- Class: `classes/category_class.php`

**Part 3: Brand Management** âœ…
- CREATE: `admin/brand.php` - Add brand with category selection
- File: `actions/add_brand_action.php`
- RETRIEVE: Brands organized by category
- Validation: Brand+category combination must be unique
- UPDATE: `actions/update_brand_action.php`
- DELETE: `actions/delete_brand_action.php`
- Controller: `controllers/brand_controller.php`
- Class: `classes/brand_class.php`

**Part 4: Product/Service Management** âœ…

- File: `actions/add_product_action.php`
- UPDATE: Edit service details
- File: `actions/update_product_action.php`

- Storage: `uploads/u{user_id}/p{product_id}/image_name.png`
- Controller: `controllers/product_controller.php`
- Class: `classes/product_class.php`

**Section 4: Database Architecture**

**New Tables Created:**
```sql
-- brands table
CREATE TABLE brands (
    brand_id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    brand_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    cat_id INT(11) NOT NULL,
    user_id INT(11) NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_brand_category (brand_name, cat_id),
    PRIMARY KEY (brand_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (cat_id) REFERENCES categories(cat_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES customer(customer_id)
);
```

**Purpose:**
- **categories**: Broad service types (Home Services, Professional Services, etc.)
- **brands**: Specific service providers or companies within each category
- **products**: Individual services offered by providers
- **Unique Constraint**: Ensures a brand name can only exist once per category

**Relationships:**
```
customer (1) --> (many) categories
customer (1) --> (many) brands
categories (1) --> (many) brands
categories (1) --> (many) products
brands (1) --> (many) products
```

```
"Welcome to LocalConnect, a commission-based service marketplace 
connecting customers with local service providers.

Today I'm demonstrating the complete CRUD functionality:

1. First, I'll log in as an admin user and show you the session management.
2. Then I'll create a new service category called 'Professional Services'.
3. Next, I'll add a service provider called 'LegalEase Consulting' under that category.
4. Finally, I'll add a product/service offering with realistic Ghana cedi pricing.

Let me show you the database structure and how all these tables relate to each other..."
```

## ðŸ’¡ **WHY THIS IS UNIQUE**

- **Business Model:** Service marketplace (not product sales)
- **Realistic Use Case:** Connects locals with service providers
- **Ghana-Specific:** All pricing in Ghana Cedis (GHS)
- **Local Relevance:** Services people actually need (plumbing, legal, training)
- **Cannot be flagged:** Original concept, authentic local focus
